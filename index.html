Makeup is something that has been gaining popularity in today's world. Today I will briefly discuss the history of makeup and answer questions on makeup, including some tips on how to look your best with makeup!
<p id="History"><b>History of Makeup</b></p>
<p>Archaelogists believe that makeup originated in ancient Eygpt and Greece, about 7,000 years ago. At this time many women used ash from matches as kohl eyeliner and the juice of berries to stain their lips into what we know today as lipstick. On the more extreme side, some women use to ingest ox blood and put leeches on their face. They did this, hoping that they would achieve a more desirable and clear complexion. Obviously, there were many health risks that women were unaware of at this time, but they did it anyway in hopes of excelling with their beauty standards.</p> 

<p id="Enjoy"><b>The Desire, Hype, and Enjoyment of Makeup</b></p>
<p><b>-Why do so many people enjoy doing makeup?</b></p>
<p>Today many men and women enjoy doing their makeup, just like the ancient people of Eygpt and Greece did centuries ago. Many believe it's expressing their creativity and artistic abilities. Makeup can be a form of self-expression and character. There are many talented beauticians who make a living off of their passion. They view it as a way of transforming themselves into a more desired version of themselves and also showing off their artistic abilities.</p>

<p id="Types"><b>Different types of makeup</b></p>
<p>As states before, people like to express themselves through makeup, while others use it as a form of art. There are different types of makeup believe it or not. We have a natural everyday wear, more glamourous makeup, and special fx makeup. Here are some examples:</p>

<p id="Tips"><b>Makeup Tips+Advice</b></p>
<p><b>-What are some tips you can give for makeup?</b></p>
<p>1) First it is necessary to know what type of skin you have first, whether you're dry, oily, or combination. </p>
<p>2) Getting a good base is vital, so wash your face, moisturize, and prime.</p> 
<p>3) Next step is eye makeup before face makeup to prevent eyeshadow fallout sticking on your face makeup.</p>
<p>4) Use foundation then concealer, this will help you use less concealer, save product, and not look cakey.</p> 
<p>5) Set your face with setting powder so you don't crease (especially if you're oily, so you don't look greasy).</p>
<p>6) Finally, finish with setting spray to help your makeup stay on and look fresh throughout the day!</p>

<p id="Cruel"><b>Cruelty Free Logo</b></p>
<p><b>-Do makeup brands test on animals?</b></p>
<p>Yes, there are makeup brands that do test on animals. However, there are many brands that are cruelty free. These brands can be identified with the cruelty free logo on the packaging or on the back of the product, here are some examples on what the logos may look like:</p>

<p><b>-What are some cruelty free brands?</b></p> 
<p>Here are some examples of cruelty free brands, both drugstore and high end:</p>

<p id="Rep"><b>Reputable Stores</b></p>
<p><b>-Where are some reputable stores to buy makeup from?</b></p> 
<p>For a lot of people, their first time buying makeup can be hard. You need to pick out foundation, concealar, and powder that is your shade and you have to know your skin type. It can be quite overwhelming to walk into CVS and see over fifty products, you wouldn't know where to begin. Two very reputable stores, where you can get help from workers is ULTA and Sephora. Both places sell a variety of products, and they have testers so you can try out the products in store without having to buy them first. However, each store has their own advantages. Both ULTA and Sephora have their advantages, when it comes to purchasing products and getting associate help.</p>

<p><b>About ULTA</b></p>
	<img src="https://www.visitburbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Ulta.jpg"alt="ULTA" style="width:400px;height:300px;">
<p>ULTA is agreat place that sells afforable and highend products, so whether your on a budget or want to splurge ULTA has your back covered. In addition you are also open to the samples to test out whatever products you want and ask an associate for help. However, most people would like to take a sample of one of the testers home, which ULTA does not permit.</p>
<p><b>About Sephora</b></p>	
    <img src="https://rctom.hbs.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/11/sephora1.jpg"alt="Sephora" style="width:400px;height:300px;">
<p>In Sephora, there are mostly high end makeup (so you may go there for more of a splurge) and many of the artists can do your makeup for you in store, unlike ULTA. Sephora can arrange an appointment where their artists teach you how to do your makeup. Sephora also allows you to choose little jar samples of tester products to take home with you to try out. </p>

<img src="http://www.airbetter.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/DRY-SKIN.jpg" alt="D" style="width:500px;height:400px;">
<p><b>-How to know if you have dry skin?</b></p>
<p>1) After you wash your face, with your cleanser of choice your skin may feel dehydrated</p> 
<p>2) When I say dry skin, it also means that your skin will feel very tight, redness may occur, </p>
<p>3) Your pores may appear small on your face </p>
<p>4) There might be a lot of flakiness, peeling, or scaling in your skin</p> 
<p>5) Check when you notice flakiness, it may be more prominent during winter and even maybe some cracking too</p>
<p>6) Try doing a patch test, put a piece of disposable paper (tissue, bathroom tissue, napkin, paper towel) on yor face and gently press for a few seconds. Remove the paper and see if there is any dampness of wet residue on the paper. If not then the necessary oils for your face are not present, thus leading to the conclusion that you may have dry skin</p></p>

<p id="Dry2"><b>Causes of Dry Skin</b></p>
<p><b>-Why do you have dry skin?</b></p>
<p><b>Well there is not one simple cause for dry skin, but here are some of the main ones below:</b></p>
<p>1) Cold weather can be a cause for dry skin, as stated above </p>
<p>2) Washing your face with harsh soaps. Sometimes people tend to over do it with washing their face, and this can be the cause of them having dry skin because they may be using a harsh soap or facial cleaner. Make sure to read the directions and recommended amount of times a product can be used a day, week, etc.</p>
<p>3) Lack of moisture in the top layers of skin can be a cause as well. That is why it is very important to keep the skin hydrated with some type of facial oil or mositurizer</p>
<p>4) Some external factors may be the cause of dry skin. These factors can range anywhere from sun damage, saunas, steam rooms, and many other heat or steam related factors</p>
<p>5) Extremely hot weather, especially in the summer. Yes, both summer and winter can make your dry skin flare up. Obviously the heat from the summer weather will reinforce the dryness of your skin</p>
<p>6) Taking long, hot showers or baths can dry your skin. Ensure skin moisturzation is at it's best and use more room temperature/cooler water when washing your face. So can frequent swimming, particularly in heavily chlorinated pools. Just ensure that you limit your amount of time in pools.</p>

<p id="Oily"><b>Signs You Have Oily Skin</b></p>
<img src="https://raoderm.com/wp-content/uploads/Oily-Skin.jpg"alt="O" style="width:500px;height:400px;">
<p><b>-How to know if you have oily skin?</b></p>
<p>1) After you wash your face, with your cleanser of choice your skin may feel oil free but shortly after you may see and feel your oilness coming back</p>
<p>2) Your skin may feel very greasy and look shiny throughout the day and you may feel the need to be blotting your face</p>
<p>3) Your pores will appear to be very large, they may also be clogged very often</p>
<p>4) People with oily skin will tend to have a lot more blackheads and pimples on their face</p>
<p>5) Your oily skin may act up most during the summer time</p>
<p>6) If you're constantly using blotting sheets throughout the day and there is oily residue, there is a good chance you have dry skin</p>

<p id="Oily2"><b>Causes of Oily Skin</b></p>
<p><b>-Why do you have oily skin?</b></p>
<p>1) Hormones and genetics are the main reason why many people have oily skin. Chances are that, oily skin runs in your family</p>
<p>2) Your diet. Oily or greasy foods can cause more oil to generate on your face</p>
<p>3) Certain medication can cause the amount of oil in your skin to become greater</p>
<p>4) Even stress can trigger the oilness in your skin to become more severe. When your body feels tense, it will release a hormone called cortisol. This will cause your oil levels to excelerate</p>
<p>5) Try to use a lighter, more natural amount of makeup. The amount of makeup you wear will affect your oil production, especially heavy makeup will make your skin's oil level increase dramatically</p>
<p>6) Overwashing your face is also bad. Yes it may dry your skin out but it will also remove the good oils and cause excessive dryness and irritation. This will increase symptoms of acne</p>
